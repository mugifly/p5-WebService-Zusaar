=head1 METHODS

=head2 new ( [%params] )

Create an instance of WebService::Zussar.

%params = (optional) LWP::UserAgent options, and encoding (example: encoding => 'utf8').

=head2 fetch ( $api_path [, %params] )

Send request to Zussar API.
Also, this method has supported a fetch like 'Auto-Pager'.

$api_path = Path of request to Zussar API. Currently available: "event" or "event/user".

%params = Query parameter.

About the query, please see: http://www.zusaar.com/doc/api.html

=head3 'AutoPager' like fetching

You can fetch all search results, by such as this code:

  # Request event
  $zussar->fetch( 'event' );
  
  # Print each events title
  while ( my $event = $zussar->next ){
        print $event->title . "\n";
  }

In the case of default, you can fetch max 10 items by single request to Zussar API.
However, this module is able to fetch all results by repeat request, automatically.
